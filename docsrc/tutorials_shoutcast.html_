<h4>Aims</h4>

<p>In this section I'm going to walk you through the procedure of setting up a Shoutcast server
and then sending a live stream to it with IDJC. In addition I will demonstrate the connection of
a listener to show that everything really does work.</p>

<p>The advice below is for demonstration purposes only. Not covered are best practices of locking
down a Shoutcast server for serious use. There are plenty of specialized Shoutcast hosting services
to take that burden, for a price.</p>

<h4>Obtaining Shoutcast</h4>

<p>Shoutcast may not be available in your Linux distribution. Not really a problem since it's available
as a presumably statically linked binary from <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com">http://www.shoutcast.com</a>.
</p>

<h4>Setting up Shoutcast</h4>

<p>Having downloaded the version of Shoutcast that's right for your platform and extracted it from
the archive you should locate the Shoutcast executable called sc_serv. This needs to be run with a suitable
confirguration file. There are some examples of these in the source tree as well as a configuration builder.
For the sake of simplicity a minimalist configuration will be used for this demonstration.
</p>

<p>Let's use a basic configuration file that we shall call sc_serv.conf which allows IDJC and listener clients to
connect to/from localhost merely for test purposes and contains the following text:</p>
<pre>
logfile=logs/sc_serv.log
w3clog=logs/sc_w3c.log
banfile=control/sc_serv.ban
ripfile=control/sc_serv.rip
password=changeme
adminpassword=protected
</pre>

<p>Let's run this with the following command.</p>

<pre>$ ./sc_serv sc_serv.conf</pre>

<p>Assuming you were not dumped back to a console prompt the server is now running.</p>

<h4>Configuring IDJC</h4>

<p>Start the JACK sound server as follows.</p>
<pre>$ jackd -d dummy -r 44100</pre>
<p>This is done so that any media player, even one that does not support JACK Audio Connection Kit can be
used for playing the stream on this machine.</p>

<p>Run IDJC open the Output window from the View menu. Click Configuration so the
configuration section is visible.</p>

<p>Click Connection, then New.</p>
<p>For Server type you want Shoutcast Master, for Hostname, localhost, port number should be 8000 and the password
will be the default password, which is <span style="color:red;" title="Obviously a server exposed to the Internet&#32;
should never be configured to use its default password">changeme</span>. Click Ok to add the server to the list.</p>

<p>Click Format. Select MPEG and click the right arrow repeatedly until all the option boxes appear.</p>

<p>Click Individual Controls so the controls section is visible and click the button that says
localhost:8000/listen.</p>

<p>If the button stays in you have made the connection.</p>

<h4>Streaming some audio</h4>

<p>Click the down pointing arrow on the left media player and using the file selector add a track to the
playlist. Click play. Make sure the crossfader is set all the way to the left. Make sure Stream is on and DJ is off.
You should be able to see the Str Peak meter is active.</p>

<p>If you can't hear anything right now it's because DJ is off and/or you are running a dummy JACK soundcard,
which is what you want for the sake of this test.</p>

<h4>Join the stream as a listener</h4>

<pre>$ mplayer http://localhost:8000/listen</pre>

<p>After a brief moment audio should start to play and within thirty seconds the listener count in the main IDJC
window should have risen to 1. It's possible to add more listeners up to the maximum number currently
specified in the Shoutcast configuration file.</p>
