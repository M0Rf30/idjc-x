<p>The following subsection takes you on a guided tour through the user interface, hopefully giving you
an idea of the current capabilities of this application.</p>

<p>It is <em>not</em> meant as documentation (that's what the tooltips are for) nor should it be
expected to remain tightly in sync whenever features change.</p>
