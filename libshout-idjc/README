libshout-idjc
-------------

Libshout-idjc is a library for communicating with and sending data to shoutcast
or icecast servers.  It's a fork of libshout that has been modified to support
features of IDJC such as AAC streams.  It handles the socket connection, the
timing of the data, and prevents bad data from getting to the server.
