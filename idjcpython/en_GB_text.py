This makes for a more natural sound and is recommended for compressing the human voice. A sensible value would be 27. Using 0 results in what is known in compressor jargon as hard knee compression.

drc_release_tip = "Release is the opposite of attack and relates to how quickly the compressor releases signal attenuation when the microphone signal level drops.
